Iâ€™m a PhD Candidate at the <a href = "https://www.technion.ac.il/">Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</a>, working under the supervision of Professor <a href = "https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/">Roi Reichart</a>.
 

My main field of research is Natural Language Processing, where I focus on Out-of-distribution generalization: domain adaptation, zero-shot learning, semi-supervised learning, integration of world knowledge into deep neural networks, generalization beyond the training distribution, cross-language and multilingual learning.
